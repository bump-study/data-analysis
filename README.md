# Data analysis for the BUMP Feasibility Study: deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular events leading to labour
<img src="readme_figures/bump.jpg" width="150" align="left"/>

Code for the transcriptomic data analysis for the [BUMP](https://bumpcollaborative.org/) (Borne Uterine Mapping Project) feasibility study. 

This is a study funded by [Borne](https://www.borne.org.uk/) that seeks to confirm the feasibility of a systematic study of the biological interactions across different cells and tissues in the human uterus; and the outline of opportunities to test and expand on novel discoveries that can help prevent the onset of preterm labour.
